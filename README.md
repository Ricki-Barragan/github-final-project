# github-final-project
**Scenario:**
You recently got hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities for low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. They want to slowly move their code to Git. You are asked to host their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey. You will not only host the script, but also follow best practices introduced in this course and create supporting documents for the open source project including a code of conduct, and contribution guidelines. Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.

**Objective:**
After completing this lab, you would have demonstrated the following:
	1.	Create a new repository in your GitHub account.
	2.	Select the appropriate license for your project.
	3.	Create a README.md file that explains the purpose of the project.
	4.	Create a Code of Conduct markdown that explains how you want the community to behave and interact with each other.
	5.	Create a Contribution Guidelines markdown that tells the community how to contribute.
	6.	Commit the new files to the repository.
A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
 

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output:
   simple interest = p*t*r
